Design Problem Statement  

As an incoming transfer student at UCLA I worried about building and maintaining a community that made me feel at home at a university with such a large student body. Since transfers do not have the traditional four year experience many feel a sense of urgency to get the most out of their two years at university whilst balancing a heavy schedule. One of the biggest aspects of university life is the social aspect - researchers have found that feeling alone can trigger many [health related issues](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691614568352). Although there are many existing Social Media apps like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to stay in contact we wanted to create an app tailored around university students and their schedules to make meeting up with friends easier. 

Persona

User Scenario - A New Beginning   

Kyle just moved into a new school from abroad, leaving behind his family and friends. He feels extremely isolated and lonely which is effecting his mood, study and work ethics. He feels himself slipping into a depressive state as weeks go by. As weeks pass by Noah finds that everyone else seems to have already found their groups and he seems to be the only one who still feels like he doesn't belong. Whilst he goes through Instagram he finds everyone having a good time. Noah comes across the app 'iKo' created by his fellow UCLA students and creates an account. He sends a request to four of his classmates from his Design class and forms a group. Now that they can see each other's schedules it makes planning out lunches and study sessions much easier. Because of this app he feels he can see his classmates more often in a social setting beyond the classroom. Kyle uses this opportunity to bond with his classmates and start a much more meaningful friendship.

Usability Testing

I conducted a usability test using the rough prototype of the app iKo on a first year transfer student at UCLA. Similar to the persona that was created the interviewee was also a student who had just moved to Los Angeles was feeling a bit overwhelmed with the new and unfamiliar environment. She was asked to complete the task of adding a new class to her own profiles schedule and to also view a schedule of one of the other test users. Whilst conducting the interview we asked her for verbal feedback whilst completing the tasks and observed the difficulty level of the tasks. 

Results and Reflection 

The interviewee was able to navigate through the website easily but pointed out difficulty in returning to the main page after completing the first task of adding a new class there was a missing back link which stopped her from returning back to the scheduling page in case she made a mistake. She also pointed out that if someone tried to add a friend's username that didn't exist the follow up page could give recommendations on similar username's to the one typed by the user in case the user accidentally misspelled it. This would also improve the 'Error Prevention' and 'Flexibility' of the app in it's Heuristic Evaluations.
